    summary: "The overall report won China Social Enterprise and Impact Investing Forum’s For Good Research Award (2023)<br><br>ISBN: 9787522833538<br><br>Publisher: Social Sciences Academic Press (China)<br><br>Abstract: After the promulgation of the Trust Law of the People's Republic of China, the Charity Law of the People's Republic of China, and the Management Measures for Charitable Trusts, charitable trusts have become a new tool for coordinating various sectors of society to engage in philanthropic and charitable activities. After years of exploratory development, the number of charitable trusts and their asset scale has grown rapidly, with innovative designs in trust models and diverse categories of assets. However, the current situation of charitable trusts in China continues to confront challenges concerning insufficient support systems, ambiguous eligibility criteria, non-standardized information disclosure, and a requisite for enhanced societal awareness. Therefore, it is imperative to enhance policy and promotional support."

  paper:
    summary: Pennsylvania’s heavy reliance on fossil fuels poses a significant challenge to the sustainable development of the power generation sector. Although Pennsylvania has joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) to reduce carbon emissions, ongoing legal disputes may compel Pennsylvania to withdraw from RGGI, resulting in significant environmental, health, and economic consequences. To mitigate these possible losses, remedial actions should tackle air pollution and environmental justice issues while introducing supplementary policies to RGGI to encourage rapid decarbonization.

    summary: "ISBN: 9787520192460<br><br>Publisher: Social Sciences Academic Press (China)<br><br>Abstract: The introduction of charitable trust system into China is relatively late. After The Trust Law of the People's Republic of China, The Charity Law of the People's Republic of China and The Management Measures of Charitable Trust were successively promulgated, the number of charitable trust filings in China has grown rapidly, with active different social entities' participation. Charitable trust generally presents a steady and positive development trend and play an important role in promoting the third distribution and helping the development of public welfare. However, the laws and regulations and supporting systems for charitable trust still need to be further improved, and the public's awareness of charitable trust also remains to be improved."
