  summary: "The project mainly utilized spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS Pro to identify potential sites for new public safety buildings in Atlantic City, focusing on accessibility, elevation, and population density. This methodical approach not only prioritizes elevated areas to mitigate flood risks but also ensures these essential facilities are strategically placed near densely populated zones for efficient emergency responses. By integrating real-world physical barriers into the analysis, the project accurately models emergency routes that adapt to unique urban and environmental challenges."
